`v3.6.0 milestone <https://github.com/opening-hours/opening_hours.js/issues?q=milestone%3Av3.6.0+is%3Aclosed>`__

Added
~~~~~

* Public holiday definitions added:

  * Australia [yourock17_, ypid_]
  * England and Wales [skifans_, simon04_]
  * Finland [Virtakuono_]
  * Greece [hariskar_]
  * Ireland [Gerw88_, ypid_]
  * Ivory Coast [sommerluk_, ypid_]
  * Norway [Gazer75_]
  * Switzerland [mstock_, emilsivro_, simonpoole_, ypid_]


* Added Easter Sunday to Slovak holidays. [chiak597_]
* Localizations added: Hungarian [urbalazs_, debyos_]

* School holiday definitions added:

  * Austria [simon04_]
  * France [blef00fr_, ypid_]
  * Germany 2017 until 2024 [ypid_]
  * Greece [hariskar_, ypid_]

* Translate error tolerance warnings into German. [ypid_]
* Add additional warnings:

  * Misused ``.`` character. Example: ``Jan 01,Dec 24.-25.``. [ypid_]
  * Trailing ``,`` after time selector. Example: ``We 12:00-18:00,``. [ypid_]
  * Additional rule which evaluates to closed. Example: ``Mo-Fr 10:00-20:00, We off``. [ypid_]
  * Value consists of multiple rules each only using a time selector. Example: ``11:30-14:30;17:30-23:00``. [ypid]
  * Potentially missing use of ``<additional_rule_separator>`` if the previous
    rule has a time range which wraps over midnight and the current rule
    matches one of the following days of the previous rule.
    One that the warning is not emitted in case wide range selectors are used
    in both involved rules to avoid a false positive warning where the two
    rules would never match days directly following each other.
    Nevertheless this check has false positives and which can be ignored in cases mentioned in the warning.
    Example: ``Fr 22:00-04:00; Sa 21:00-04:00`` [ypid_]

* Extend error tolerance:

  * Handle super/subscript digits properly. Example: ``Mo 00³°-¹⁴:⁰⁹``. [ypid_]
  * Handle misused ``.`` character following a number. Example: ``Jan 01,Dec 24.-25.``. [ypid_]


Changed
~~~~~~~

* Public holiday definitions updated:

  * Germany [StephanGeorg_]

* Migrated to use `ES2015 modules`_ and rollup_ for module bundling. [simon04_]
* Increased NodeJS version requirement to ``6.0.0``. Technically, the code should still work with ``4.0.0`` but support has been dropped because ``npm-install-peers`` depends on ``6.0.0``. [ypid_]
* Update to holiday definition format 2.2.0. Holidays are now maintained in
  YAML files, one for each country. [ypid_]
* Update to holiday definition format 3.0.0. Use nested key-value pairs
  instead of arrays with a known structure. [ypid_]
* Rework the way Nominatim responses are handled (used for testing). [ypid_]
* Allow "gaps" in school holiday definitions. This became necessary because
  countries/states might add/remove holidays like winter holidays from one year
  to another. [ypid_]

* Error tolerance: For a value such as ``Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00 by_appointment`` the
  tool did previously suggest to use ``Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00 "on appointment"`` but
  as whether to use ``by appointment`` or ``on appointment`` is not defined the
  tool now just uses the already given variant (``Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00 "by
  appointment"`` in this case). [ypid_]

* Error tolerance: Interpret the German :regexp:`werktags?` as ``Mo-Sa`` instead of ``Mo-Fr``.
  Ref: `§ 3 Bundesurlaubsgesetz (BUrlG) <https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/burlg/__3.html>`_. [ypid_]

* Make error tolerance warnings translatable. [ypid_]

* Improved performance of common constructor calls by factor 6! [ypid_]
* Improve number input in the evaluation tool and other HTML and CSS improvements. Useful for example on mobile devices. [HolgerJeromin_, ypid_]

* Merge country into state holidays. This avoids repeating country-wide holidays.
  [simon04_]

.. _ES2015 modules: http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html
.. _rollup: http://rollupjs.org/

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fix German public holiday definitions. Since 2018, Reformationstag is also a public holiday in Bremen, Schleswig-Holstein, Niedersachsen and Hamburg. [Discostu36_, ypid_]
* Fix Russian public holiday definitions. Regions where not in local language and thus not matched properly. [ypid_]
* Fix school holiday selector code which caused the main selector traversal
  function to not advance any further (returning closed for all following dates) after the
  school holiday selector code hit a holiday definition ending on the last
  day of the year. [ypid_]
* Fix ``check-diff-%.js`` Makefile target. :command:`git diff` might not have
  shown changes or failed to return with an error before. [ypid_]
* Fix support for legacy browsers (IE) with using proper for...in loops. [shouze_]
* Error tolerance: Fix mapping of Spanish weekdays. [maxerickson_]

    been wrong before. [ypid_]

* Fix timezone problem in ``PH_SH_exporter.js`` (local time was interpreted as UTC). [ypid_]
* Fix handling of legacy 12-hour clock format. ``12:xxAM`` and ``12:xxPM`` was handled incorrectly! [ypid_]
* Fix timezone issue for `PH_SH_exporter.js` unless the ``--omit-date-hyphens`` option was given.
  Exported dates which are in DST might be wrong when your system is in a
  timezone with DST and DST was not active when you run the script. [ypid_]
* Fix current week number calculation which was caused by incorrect use of
  ``new Date()`` which is a "Reactive" variable. [spawn-guy_]
