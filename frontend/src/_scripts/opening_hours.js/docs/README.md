## Terminology

    Mo-Fr 10:00-11:00;  Th 10:00-12:00
    \_____rule_____/  \ \____rule____/
                       \
                        ";" Rule separator (could also be "," or "||")

    Jan Mo-Fr 10:00-11:00
    \_/ \___/ \_________/
    selectors (left to right: month, weekday, time)

    Logic:
    - Tokenize
    Foreach rule:
    - Run top-level (rule) parser
      - Which calls sub parser for specific selector types
        - Which produce selector functions

## Tokens

The tokens are stored in the array `tokens` which has the following structure. The example results from the value `We-Fr 10:00-24:00 open "it is open", Mo closed "It‘s monday." || 2012 "please call"; Jan 1 open "should never appear"` which is in the test framework.

The most inner array represents one token. The first element of this array is the [lexeme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme) (an internal representation of the token value). The second element is the token name and the third one is the start position of the token in the input stream (which is used for generation warnings and let the user know the position where the problem occurred). The fourth element is optional and specifies to which selector the token belongs to.

```JavaScript
[ // Tokenized input stream
    [ // One rule
        [ // All tokens of one rule. Referred to as "selector array of tokens".
            [ // Referred to as "token array".
